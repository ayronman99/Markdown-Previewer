# Markdown previewer: a simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and so on to a plain text. Markdown uses a simple formatting syntax to accomplish the same thing that HTML does, but it is simpler than HTML.

My 2nd project to integrate on my portfolio. Based on (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)
